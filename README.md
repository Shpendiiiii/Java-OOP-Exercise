# OOP with Java
This is a Java program that demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
The program creates a `Student` class that can be used to store information about a student 
such as name, age, program and year of study.

## Class Details
The `Student` class has four private instance variables: `name`, `age`, `program`, and `year`. These variables are used to store the student's information.

The class has four setter methods (**setName, setAge, setProgram, and setYear)** that allow the user to set the values of the instance variables.

The class also has four getter methods **(getName, getAge, getProgram, and getYear)** that allow the user to retrieve the values of the instance variables.

The `toString` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the student object, which includes all of the student's information.

## Main Class
The `Main` class creates an instance of the `Student` class and sets its values using the setter methods. The `toString` method is called as an example to display the student's information and the `getAge` method is called to retrieve the student's age.

## Usage
This program can be used as a template for creating a student class and can be easily extended to include additional information and methods as needed.
